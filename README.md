# cairokane

Scaffolding for a cairo-vm verifier built to an alkane.

Ultimately we attempt to utilize the cairo-vm crate built for wasm32-unknown-unknown.

The canonical cairo-vm is forked to [https://github.com/kungfuflex/cairo-vm](https://github.com/kungfuflex/cairo-vm) to update rustc and wasm-bindgen to fit nicely into the build system.

Still a WIP.
